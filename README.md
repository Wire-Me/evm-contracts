# About

This repository contains the source code for WireMe's EVM smart contracts, unit tests for these contracts, and scripts
to compile and deploy the contracts. It also uses ENV vars to configure the private keys used to deploy contracts.

# Setup

## ENV Vars
Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository using `.env.example` as a template

Set the local node URL env var to point to your node running on localhost

Set your private keys for the accounts you want to use for deploying contracts. For localhost, Hardhat will use the public
accounts generated by the local node. For Sepolia and Mainnet, you will need to provide your own private keys.

## Install Dependencies

Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies for the project.

# Deployment
Use Hardhat Ignition to deploy smart contracts

To localhost
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts --network localhost
```
To Sepolia
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts --network sepolia
```
